The apps return in different languages, handle different data sources with different data tools.  All these apps now are parking as silos in different government agencies’ DC.  When the number of apps increase : development, provisioning, management and communications all become tedious jobs . This become a challenge on how to reuse these assets to rapidly develop new apps, do innovations via software.
